<h1>Comparing GitHub Pages and Other Website Development Platforms</h1>

<p>Developing a website in GitHub Pages offers a unique experience compared to other website platforms. In this essay, I’ll compare my experience working with GitHub Pages to developing on sites.psu.edu, focusing on the main differences, challenges, and skills required in each environment.</p>

<h2>Challenges for New Learners</h2>

<p>As a new learner, GitHub Pages can feel challenging due to its technical setup. It requires an understanding of Git commands, Markdown, and HTML, which may be overwhelming at first. By contrast, Penn State Sites uses a more beginner-friendly drag-and-drop interface, allowing new users to create pages without needing to code. This setup makes it much easier to get started quickly.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Each Platform</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages is powerful for users looking for full control over their site’s design and functionality. Its ability to use custom code and templates offers a high level of customization and is free with custom domain support. On the other hand, Penn State sites is advantageous for its ease of use and speed in setting up pages. It’s ideal for those who prefer a visual interface and don’t want to focus on the technical aspects of web development.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Modifying Layout and Organization</h2>

<p>Modifying the layout in GitHub Pages requires knowledge of HTML and CSS, which gives more control but demands more technical knowledge. Conversely, Penn State sites provides templates that make layout adjustments simple but limit customization. This trade-off means that GitHub Pages allows for more personalized design, while Penn State sites streamlines the process for those who want a quick, clean look without coding.</p>

<h2>Skills Needed for Each Platform</h2>

<p>Working with GitHub Pages requires foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and Git commands to manage files. Penn State sites mostly requires familiarity with the platform’s interface and basic design principles, as the platform handles the technical aspects. Both platforms benefit from additional CSS skills for styling and layout adjustments, though GitHub Pages users may also find JavaScript helpful for adding interactivity.</p>

<h2>Skills I Want to Improve</h2>

<p>Moving forward, I plan to strengthen my CSS skills to create more engaging layouts and improve usability. I also want to explore JavaScript, which would allow me to add interactive features to my GitHub Pages site. Learning these skills will help me tailor my sites more effectively for different audiences and goals.</p>
