            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Path of Kami Demo* offers a relaxing and enjoyable gaming experience, perfect for players looking for something calm and puzzle-focused. 
        However, I think the game could benefit from incorporating occasional, more challenging puzzles to add variety and keep players on their toes. 
        I look forward to seeing how the game develops in the future!</p>
